        <p>VLL has an exclusive arrangement with Solar Inception to design, construct and certify Photovoltaic Systems on a commercial scale up to and beyond 1 Megawatt. This partnership has ensured that our clients are not only serviced at every level from the initial enquiry through to the installation but we also ensure that you will receive a competitive pricing structure on like for like systems. We do not profess to be the cheapest, we will not install where it is unsafe or likely to give our client a poor return on investment or yield due to its location. However, we do offer honest and reliable advice, after sales support and warranties that are second to none! For added piece of mind, make it a VLL Solar installation.</p>
      </div>


      <p>Our specialist team of engineers, project managers and Clean Energy Council accredited installers can provide expert advice and installations from small to large scale projects so whether you are considering implementing a solar package on your property at home to reduce your electricity bill or are a large Corporation or Government Department planning something special then please feel free to get in contact for a consultation with a specialist PV Engineer. </p>

      <h3 class="green">Why Solar?</h3>
      <p>Our Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems are installed by clients who want to benefit from true technology that reduces their operational expenses and protects them against future increases in energy prices with dependability.  In short, our systems perform in real world conditions and deliver on their promise of future cost avoidance because we carefully evaluate each case individually and only use the very best products manufactured by the world leaders in this technology.</p>

      <p>What is the Government saying about Solar? Through its Renewable Energy Target (RET) Scheme, the Australian Government has pledged that by 2020, 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will come from renewable sources. This Scheme provides those who invest in Solar Systems with the confidence that their investment is not only green and socially responsible, but will be guaranteed by the government for the duration of the program.
</p>
      <p>Government benefits - In addition to generous State guaranteed feed-in-tariffs which provide ongoing returns for electricity exported to the grid, home and business owners can also benefit from solar credits (STCs) which subsidise the installation cost. </p>

      <h3 class="green">I don't understand, what's an STC?</h3>
      <p>Don't worry if you do not understand how the Government rebate structure works, at VLL we are here to make things easy! Typically our contractor will ask you whether you would like to keep your certificates to trade in at a later date however most clients choose to sign these over to the installing contractor in order to receive an instant discount on the cost of installing your new PV system.</p>

      <h3 class="green">It makes smart business sense!</h3>
      <p>In our professional opinion, long gone are the days where a PV Solar system would make you rich, make the meter spin backwards or pay for the kids schooling! However it still makes smart business sense to invest your hard earned capital now in order to offset your quarterly energy bill against your installation. Typically most installations of 3kw or above will see an instant reduction in costs and even flat line your energy bill where a high yield is achieved from using quality panels and invertors supplied by VLL.</p>
